# InstantCook
An iOS Recipe Mobile Application

This application provides users a list of food recipes that they can cook based on what ingredients they have in their fridge. There are also some side features such as showing the user the closest supermarket locations around him/her (if location services is enabled) and letting the user add food recipes to their favorites so that they can go back and check the recipes they liked. This project helped me gain a lot more experience in Swift programming and its libraries as well as using Firebase authentication (user login/sign-up) and database (to read/write ingredients and favorite recipes) services, getting data from an external food recipe API provided by "Spoonacular" and improve my UX/UI design skills by using Sketch to design the layout of my application.
